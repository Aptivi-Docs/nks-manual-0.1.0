# ðŸ”¼ Upgrading to API v3.0 series

As API v3.0 is still in development, the breaking changes get committed and land here. They describe what broke and what should be used instead.

{% hint style="danger" %}
## Critically important notices

When upgrading your mods to API v3.0, consider these:

* Starting from 0.1.0, old configuration styles are no longer supported and are kept in your home directory for reference. The kernel will start from scratch as if you've started it for the first time. Don't worry; all your configuration from 0.0.24.0 are still saved in your home directory. This is because of configuration system changes that happened between 0.0.24.0 and 0.1.0.
* .NET Framework 4.8 is **no longer supported** as of 0.1.0 Beta 1. Please consider using .NET 8.0 instead to continue using Nitrocid KS. This is to improve multi-platform support without having to go to one environment (`dotnetfx` on Windows and `mono` on Linux and macOS) for each platform. This is done starting from API version `3.0.25.310`.
* Starting from API version `3.0.25.123`, the mod versions should satisfy the SemVer v2.0 specification. Mod parsing will fail if an invalid version expression is entered.
* Starting from API version `3.0.25.154`, the mod loader will fail if the mod is not strongly signed using any strong naming key and loading untrusted mods is disabled.
* Starting from API version `3.0.25.361`, mods are no longer organized with mod parts. This feature has been removed and won't be coming back.
* Starting from API version `3.0.25.380`, the root namespace has been changed from KS to Nitrocid. This means that you need to update your mods to point to the newer root namespace.
* Starting from API version, `3.0.25.383`, the mod name and the mod version must be specified, because if they aren't specified, the mod parsing fails.

The explanation about these changes can be found at the bottom of this page.

## From 0.0.24 to 0.1.0

This version is a futuristic magic that brings in many feature additions and spectacular improvements in all fields, including cosmetic changes.

### Detailed important changes

This section explains how to adapt the important changes to your mod code so that it works with 0.1.0 and higher. This highlights the most important changes that we have compiled for you.

#### Old configuration styles

The following configuration files (incomplete list) have been changed entirely from 0.0.24.x to at least 0.1.0 to better fit the requirements of having the clean home directory (i.e. moved from the user profile directory to the local application data directory):

```

After you upgrade Nitrocid KS 0.0.24.x to 0.1.0, running it may yield first-time run wizards, thinking that all your configuration is lost. However, they're not lost, because the old configuration styles will not be deleted by 0.1.0. Unfortunately, the two configuration styles are not compatible with each other, meaning that you'll have to manually replicate the configuration that you had made when you were using 0.0.24.x.

This is intentionally done to make the configuration reader and the writer faster than before due to the usage of the serialization techniques, compared to the old method of manually parsing every single configuration key and installing them to the appropriate variables. The new reader and writer also allows more flexibility due to how they're implemented, causing your mods to be more configurable than before.

You can learn more about why we've made these changes, as well as a list of commits that may explain more, [here](from-0.1.0-beta-1-to-0.1.0-beta-2.md#removed-the-field-manager).
{% endhint %}

#### Removal of .NET Framework 4.8 support

After 0.0.24.x, you'll notice that we no longer ship a version that is compatible with the .NET Framework 4.8 that is pre-installed in the latest versions of Windows. This is because we have started using features that are exclusive to the modern .NET, and Nitrocid KS 0.1.0 and above currently uses .NET 8.0 as the minimum version needed to run. As such, we've decided to change the requirements according to this change.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please consider using .NET 8.0 instead to continue using Nitrocid KS. This is to improve multi-platform support without having to go to one environment (`dotnetfx` on Windows and `mono` on Linux and macOS) for each platform.
{% endhint %}

Fortunately, we still maintain the 0.0.24.x version, which still supports .NET Framework 4.8. This version will be supported until the full .NET Framework 4.8 deprecation, which will not happen until further notice.

#### Significant improvements to your mods

Starting from 0.1.0, we've significantly made improvements as to how your mods start. Your mods have become more powerful than before, and we're still working on it to ensure that they get more control over how Nitrocid and its addons work. As part of this significant improvement effort that happened during the entire development cycle of this version, we had to do the following important changes to ensure that your mods have the highest quality possible:

* We have removed organizing multiple mods that have the same name using mod parts, because they were relevant back when mods consisted of just a single source code file (Visual Basic or C#) and large mods would be grouped using multiple source code files that inter-operate with each other. Some versions ago, we had removed source-code-based mods and relied on mod developers to make `.DLL` versions to ensure that they get the most flexibility possible. This feature won't be coming back because of its rigidity. See why [here](from-0.1.0-beta-2-to-0.1.0-beta-3.md#removed-mod-parts).
* All pre-API v3.0 versions of Nitrocid KS, including 0.0.24.x, had `KS` as its root namespace, because the name was Kernel Simulator back then. We have given this application a name, called Nitrocid KS, and the kernel name has been changed to Nitrocid Kernel. As a result, the root namespace has been changed from `KS` to `Nitrocid` to be more consistent with the application branding. Some of the breaking change notes still use the `KS` root namespace for historical reasons and they should not be modified as they list the history of changes that happened between the previous version and the next version. You'll have to update your imports to point to the new root namespace. See why [here](from-0.1.0-beta-3-to-0.1.0-rc.md#changed-the-root-namespace).
* Earlier, we had allowed empty mod names and versions, because, back then, they were relevant in cases which the mod authors have decided not to provide the mod name and the mod version, but still provide the mod name as the file name of the loose source code file. Some versions ago, we had removed source-code-based mods for the first reason mentioned above. As a result, we've mandated the mod name and the mod version so that every mod that don't have their name and/or their version will not be parsed. They'll fail to load. See why [here](from-0.1.0-beta-3-to-0.1.0-rc.md#mandatory-mod-version-and-name-properties).
* Also, we have mandated the mod versioning via the SemVer v2.0 versioning scheme. This is to filter versions that are completely or partially invalid to ensure that only valid versions (revisions or not) are allowed. This is mandatory for mods that target Nitrocid KS 0.1.0 to ensure that the mod authors version their mods properly as all the kernel mods are glorified class libraries.
* Finally, we have made signing your mods using your strong name key mandatory. This is to make sure that your mods have a unique identity and that they are attributed to you. This is also to protect the kernel from rogue and often unsigned kernel mods that may cause problems with the kernel or your computer. Although strong naming is generally just for identity, Nitrocid's mod manager will refuse to load mods that are not strongly named for security.

For instructions on how to strongly name your mods, you can consult the below page to perform this operation.

### Other breaking changes

We have highlighted the most important breaking changes for your kernel mods. Now, for the other breaking changes, you'll need to adapt the changed from 0.0.24.x to 0.1.0 using the guides that are explained in the below pages:

The below sections specify the post-0.1.0 releases.

## From 0.1.0.0 to 0.1.0.3

Between 0.1.0.0 and 0.1.0.3, we've made the following breaking changes:

### Updated Terminaux to 3.3.0.1

We've updated Terminaux to 3.3.0.1 to fix a bug related to the selection style crashing when pressing ESC. In consequence, because the fix was released after the 3.3.0 release, we had to increase the mod API version to `3.0.25.439`.

You can consult the list of breaking changes that result from upgrading Terminaux 3.2.0 to 3.3.0 by pressing the below button:
